    <aside>
        <p>The aside HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</p>

    <main id="main-content">
        <!-- main page content -->
        <hgroup id="document-title">
            <h1>Main</h1>
            <p>The main HTML element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</p>
            <p>The hgroup HTML element represents a heading and related content. It groups a single h1–h6 element with one or more p.</p>
            <p>The hgroup presently has no strong accessibility semantics. The content of the element (a heading and optional paragraphs) is what is exposed by browser accessibility APIs.</p>
        </hgroup>

        <section>
            <h2>Heading</h2>
            <p>Section is a generic sectioning element, and should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent it. As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a nav element, but a list of search results or a map display and its controls don't have specific elements, and could be put inside a section.</p>
        </section>

            <p>The article HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</p>

            <aside>

            </footer>
            <article>
                <p>When an article element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be article elements nested in the article representing the blog post.</p>
            </article>
        </article>
        
    </main>

    <footer>
        <p>
            The footer HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
