default_bits = 2048

# It is used if the -new option is used.
# It can be overridden by using the -newkey option.

# This is equivalent to the -nodes command line option.
# For compatibility encrypt_rsa_key is an equivalent option.

# This option specifies the digest algorithm to use.
# Possible values include md5 sha1 mdc2.

# This option can be overridden on the command line.

prompt = no
# If set to the value no this disables prompting of certificate fields
# and just takes values from the config file directly.
# It also changes the expected format of the distinguished_name and attributes sections.

utf8 = yes
# If set to the value yes then field values to be interpreted as UTF8 strings,
# by default they are interpreted as ASCII. This means that the field values,
# whether prompted from a terminal or obtained from a configuration file, must
# be valid UTF8 strings.

# This specifies the configuration file section containing a list of extensions
# to add to the certificate request. It can be overridden by the -reqexts
# command line switch. See the x509v3_config(5) manual page for details of the
# extension section format.
